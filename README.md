# TOUR_AND_TRAVEL_CUSTOMER_CHURN_PREDICTION

1. Import Libraries:

Start by importing necessary libraries for data handling (pandas, numpy), visualization (matplotlib, seaborn), and machine learning (sklearn). These will help in analyzing the data and building predictive models.
2. Load and Explore Dataset:

Load the dataset containing customer information and churn status, which might include features like customer demographics, booking history, travel preferences, and interactions with the company.
Perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset, identify any patterns related to customer churn, and check for missing values.
3. Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values through imputation or removal, depending on the significance and volume of missing data.
Convert categorical features into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding, ensuring the model can process all relevant information.
Scale or normalize numerical features to ensure uniformity, especially for algorithms sensitive to feature scaling like Logistic Regression or SVM.
4. Train-Test Split:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets, making sure the distribution of churned versus non-churned customers is similar in both sets.
This will enable the model to be evaluated effectively on unseen data, simulating real-world predictions.
5. Handle Class Imbalance:

Customer churn datasets are often imbalanced, with fewer customers actually churning. Use techniques like oversampling the minority class (churned customers), undersampling the majority class (non-churned customers), or applying SMOTE to generate synthetic samples for the minority class.
6. Model Training:

Train various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks to predict customer churn.
Use cross-validation to fine-tune model hyperparameters, ensuring the model generalizes well to new data.
7. Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the models using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC, focusing on the model’s ability to correctly identify customers at risk of churning.
Consider the trade-off between false positives (predicting churn when the customer won’t) and false negatives (failing to predict churn when the customer will), depending on the business context.
8. Model Deployment and Monitoring:

Deploy the best-performing model to predict customer churn in a real-world scenario.
Monitor the model’s performance over time, retraining it periodically as customer behavior and market conditions change.
